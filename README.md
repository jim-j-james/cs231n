#### Assignment 1
                

+ Q1: k-Nearest Neighbor Classifier - KNN algorithm implementation
    + [knn.ipynb](https://github.com/jim-j-james/cs231n/blob/main/assignment1/knn.ipynb)
		+ Utilises the CIFAR10 dataset with 5000 training and 500 test records.
		+ Computes the distance metric with two, one and no loops.
		+ Crossvalidates with different values of K to find the optimal one.
    + [k_nearest_neighbor.py](https://github.com/jim-j-james/cs231n/blob/main/assignment1/cs231n/classifiers/k_nearest_neighbor.py)
		+ Implemetation of distance metric with two, one and no loops.
		+ Implements the Knn logic where the  most frequent out of k neighbors are assigned to each point
